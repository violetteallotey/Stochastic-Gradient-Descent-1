## Comparing Models and drawing conclusion

From the results we had during the training of the data, the  Random Forest Model had a lower root mean squared error than the  Stochastic Gradient Model. While on the testing data, the  Random Forest Model still had a lower root mean squared error than the  Stochastic Gradient Model.  

But then, when you compare the results of both models during training and testing, you will realize that the training error of both models were lower than the generalization error which means that the models are overfitting the training data. 

The Random Forest Model performed best compared to the Stochastic Gradient Model.
